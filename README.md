urw-grotesk-gpl
===============

This project is derived from the Type-1 font *U004006T URW Grotesk 2031 Bold* and aims at creating a free *URW Grotesk GPL* typeface with multiple usable fonts. I'm striving for a faithful rendition of Hermann Zapf's *URW Grotesk* typeface for day-to-day usage.

*URW Grotesk GPL* currently supports a basic set of glyphs and rudimentary kerning, both based directly on the Type-1 font.

Legal Notice
---------------

Since the font software in this repo is directly derived from URW's old Type-1 font licensed under GPLv2+, it carries the same license:

I couldn't find out if URW/URW++ made the source font *U004006T* also available under additional licenses, like LPPL, as they did with other fonts. If you know about this or later versions of this font released under a free license, I'd be happy to hear about it.
